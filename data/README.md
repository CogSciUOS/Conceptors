## Databases
This folder contains the database and sources for songdata. Mostly those are .wav files
and their corresponding textgrid information. Since those are quite big only a script is provided to retrieve those.

### birddb
This database can be found on the website of the [Taylor Lab](http://taylor0.biology.ucla.edu/birdDBQuery/) and used for querying different bird species for data files of their songs.

## Textgrid programs
There are quite some programs around for analyzing textgrid data. The one recommended in the robindb
sources is praat which looks roughly like this:

But there are a lot of alternatives (like [TextGridLab] (https://textgrid.de/en_US/download))
