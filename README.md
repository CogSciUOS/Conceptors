# Conceptors

This repository contains all resources for the study project "Controlling non-autonomous dynamical systems with conceptors - Exploring high-dimensional state spaces". We focus on applying conceptors as first described by Herbert JÃ¤ger to birdsong data, generating a hierarchical model that is capable of recognizing and classifying different sequences of syllables.
