# Conceptors

This repository contains all resources for the study project "Controlling non-autonomous dynamical systems with conceptors - Exploring high-dimensional state spaces". We focus on applying conceptors as first described by Herbert JÃ¤ger to birdsong data, generating a hierarchical model that is capable of recognizing and classifying different sequences of syllables.

## Dependencies
All project files are written in python 3, some of the demo The dependencies needed for this project can be installed via:
```pip3 install numpy python_speech_features```
