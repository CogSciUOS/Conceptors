# Conceptors

This repository contains all resources for the study project "Controlling non-autonomous dynamical systems with conceptors - Exploring high-dimensional state spaces". We focus on applying conceptors as first described by Herbert JÃ¤ger to birdsong data, generating a hierarchical model that is capable of recognizing and classifying different sequences of syllables.

## Dependencies
All project files are written in python 3 and some of the demo files use IPython Notebooks. The dependencies needed for this project can be installed via:

```
pip3 install numpy python_speech_features
```

## Modules
The source files for running the classification and implementation of Conceptors can be found in the `src` directory, while the files to download birdsongs and syllables reside in the `data` folder.
